## Project Description
SeedLink serves as a one-stop platform for the public to conveniently connect with different organisations for volunteering opportunities. Organisations will have their own accounts on SeedLink and can perform any functions required on-site, reducing the hassle for users to navigate to external pages. Besides basic features like displaying volunteering opportunities, SeedLink has two exceptional functionalities:

1. Interactive Homepage (Users) → “Swipe left - swipe right” function allows users to save volunteering opportunities quickly and intuitively.

2. Points Based System (Users/Organisations) → Points encourage users to volunteer more and organisations to improve their support systems, enhancing civic participation.
